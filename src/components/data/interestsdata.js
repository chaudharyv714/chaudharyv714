In my short stint of 2.5 months I grew very fond of DPA, when I went there I was more of a student who can code and when I came out I was a developer who is yet to complete his graduation. Most of my skillset I have learnt here, itself the biggest  of them being the teamwork, It's lovely to see how everyone is ready to help each other despite having their own chores. Was a wonderful experience working as a 'Decimal' ",
